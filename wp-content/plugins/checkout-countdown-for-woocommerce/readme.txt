 Improve cart conversion with Checkout Countdown for WooCommerce. The countdown timer starts when products are added to the cart.

== Description ==

Checkout Countdown for WooCommerce improves cart conversion by introducing a countdown timer as soon as any product has been added to the cart. Lower your abandoned cart rate by letting your customers know exactly how long their order can be reserved. Easy to set up and customize. It's a full cart timer, not just a product timer!

### Checkout Countdown Features include

* Wordpress 5.4+ and WooCommerce version 4.0 + ready.
* Top bar and banner. Display the countdown across your whole site. The bar only appears once a product has been added to the customer’s cart.
* Set up a separate banner message for sales marketing that appear before any products have been added to cart.
* Multiple styles e.g WooCommerce cart/checkout notice countdown timer (adapts to your theme style).
* Easy shortcode for custom placement **[checkout_countdown]**.
* Customize countdown text and expired cart text.
* Customize banner background color and font color.
* Great for FOMO (fear of missing out) and to help lower cart abandonedment.


### Also great for WooCommerce ticket sales!

A checkout or cart countdown timer can help your store make those product sales quicker. It's a good addition to WooCommerce Event ticket sales and WooCommerce Bookings.

### Extended features available with Checkout Countdown Pro

 * Empty and clear the WooCommerce cart as a timed event while customers are active on your site.
 * Restart and loop the countdown after it's finished.
 * Reset the countdown when another product is added to cart.
 * Recalculate the cart and checkout totals with every timer loop. Totals are reloaded live without the page refreshing, so customers don’t lose any details in the checkout. Useful for WooCommerce stores with live market rates.
 * AJAX Support for starting the timer when a product is added to the cart without reloading the page.
* Custom redirect after countdown timer has finished.
